# MCP Agent Capacity Planning Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidance for planning Microsoft Cloud Platform (MCP) agent deployment when integrating ServiceNow with Azure Entra ID. Understanding proper agent capacity is crucial for maintaining efficient synchronization and ensuring system reliability.

## Agent Capacity Metrics

### Single Agent Capacity
A single MCP agent can typically handle:
- Up to 50,000 users for standard synchronization
- Up to 1,000 API calls per minute
- Up to 200 concurrent operations
- Up to 5,000 group memberships

### Performance Factors
Key metrics that influence agent performance:
1. **Synchronization Frequency**
   - Full sync: Every 24 hours (recommended)
   - Delta sync: Every 5-10 minutes
   - Real-time updates: As needed

2. **Data Volume**
   - Number of users
   - Number of groups
   - Number of attributes per user
   - Frequency of user attribute changes

3. **Network Considerations**
   - Latency between ServiceNow and Azure
   - Available bandwidth
   - Network reliability

## When to Scale Agents

### Multiple Agents Scenarios

1. **Large User Base**
   - 50,000+ users
   - High frequency of user updates
   - Complex attribute mappings

2. **Geographic Distribution**
   - Multiple data centers
   - Regional compliance requirements
   - Latency optimization needs

3. **High Availability Requirements**
   - 99.99% uptime requirements
   - Failover capabilities needed
   - Zero-downtime maintenance required

### Scaling Guidelines

Number of Agents Required:
- Up to 50,000 users: 1 agent
- 50,000-100,000 users: 2 agents
- 100,000-200,000 users: 3-4 agents
- 200,000+ users: Custom planning required
